			<h1 style="color:white;">Animals drive out Mr. Jones</h1>
			<ul style="color:white; font-size:150%;">
				<li>When the animals starved, this represented the famine spreading throughout Russia after WW1.</li>
				<li>When the animals barged in on the food shed because they were starved, the February revolution is portrayed.</li>
				<li>In the February Revolution, hungry protestors protested in Petrograd; their constant riots for food eventually led to the downfall of the czar.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="linkClass" id="page2">
			<h1 style="color:white;">Pigs take over leadership</h1>
			<ul style="color:white; font-size:150%;">
				<li>After the czar was kicked out, the Bolsheviks, who represent the pigs, took charge of the revolution/rebellion.</li>
				<li>The song ‘Beasts of England’ somewhat represents ‘The Internationale.’</li>
				<li>However, while Beasts of England was banned, The Internationale was kept as the national anthem for the Soviets.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="linkClass" id="page3">
			<h1 style="color:white;">Battle of the Cowshed</h1>
			<ul style="color:white; font-size:150%;">
				<li>Jones rallies other farmers to take control of the farm again.</li>
				<li>His supporters secretly scheme to benefit from Jones’s dilemma of trying to win the farm back.</li>
				<li>The Battle of the Cowshed represents Russian civil war between the Bolsheviks (Reds) and allied forces (Whites).</li>
				<li>Jones’s sympathizers represent the allied forces comprised of militarists and government figures who wanted to expel the Bolsheviks and take control of the government again.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="linkClass" id="page4">
			<h1 style="color:white;">Snowball's re-education programs and committees</h1>
			<ul style="color:white; font-size:150%;">
				<li>Snowball’s programs and committees are reminiscent of the New Economic Policy the Soviets employed to rebuild from the wars.</li>
				<li>The NEP programs were formed to increase agricultural yield and help rebuild the economy in Russia.</li>
				<li>In Animal Farm, similarly, the programs were created to advance the farm through industrial and educational means.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="linkClass" id="page5">
			<h1 style="color:white;">Snowball's windmill idea</h1>
			<ul style="color:white; font-size:150%;">
				<li>The windmill in Animal Farm represents the new technology of the Soviets. </li>
				<li>So Trotsky introduced new technology, but Stalin disagrees until Trotsky is banished.</li>
				<li>Stalin then re-introduces new technology into the Soviets.</li>
				<li>Stalin’s 13th five year plan is basically the windmill in the book.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="linkClass" id="page6">
			<h1 style="color:white;">Napoleon vs Snowball</h1>
			<ul style="color:white; font-size:150%;">
				<li>Napoleon and Snowball were against each other in the book which relates to reality, because Stalin and Trotsky were enemies.</li>
				<li>According to johndclair.gov, Stalin and Trotsky were about the same age and they got along for a bit when Lenin was alive, but they never really had any friendship.</li>
				<li>When Lenin got sick, the tiny bit of relationship that Stalin and Trotsky died with him, and Trotsky, just like snowball, was exiled.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="linkClass" id="page7">
			<h1 style="color:white;">Snowball's Exile</h1>
			<ul style="color:white; font-size:150%;">
				<li>One of the main reason of the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) was to exile Trotsky and his allies.</li>
				<li>He was exiled by Stalin after their intense battle succeeding Lenin’s death.</li>
				<li>He changed his name to Leon Trotsky to escape from his exile, but was exiled several more times and was eventually killed by Ramón Mercader with an ax right outside of Mexico City.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="linkClass" id="page8">
			<h1 style="color:white;">Snowball is blamed for the destruction of the windmill</h1>
			<ul style="color:white; font-size:150%;">
				<li>After Trotsky’s exile, Stalin continues to blame multiple things on Trotsky and soon the whole country agrees with him.</li>
				<li>Trotsky then fell into a world of “utopianism” where Stalin went on to become a dictator.</li>
				<li>This is just like when Napoleon changed from the perfect working world that was envisioned by Old Major to more of a dictatorship.</li>
